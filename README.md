# NAND-GATE
A NAND gate is a universal digital logic gate that performs the inverse operation of the AND gate. 
It has two or more input signals and one output signal.
The output of the NAND gate becomes low (0) only when all input signals are high and for all other input combinations the output remains high (1). 
The NAND operation is represented as the complement of the AND operation.
NAND gates are called universal gates because any digital logic circuit including AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and XNOR gates, can be constructed using only NAND gates.
